# Require NPM Packages

This example demonstrates requiring NPM packages. The [CryptoJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) module
is loaded from `sha256.js` using `require` and a function `sha256()`
is exported which converts strings to [sha256 hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-256).

In order to run this example, first install the NPM packages
specified in the `package.json` file by running th following command:
`$ npm install`

`main.py` is the entry point of this example.
